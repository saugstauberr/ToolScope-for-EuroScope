## What is ToolScope?
ToolScope is a tool which allows you to update your EuroScope AIRAC or even just install a AIRAC package for a new sector without having to type your credentials and your hoppie code ever again! 
And the best thing: **It's super easy to use!** 👌

- ⚙️ install a new AIRAC or update an existing one
- 📃 AIRAC Manager (manage all installed packages or uninstall them)
- 🔄️ automatic file download and extraction
- ⌨️ never type in your credentials and hoppie code again manually
- ⬇️ drop-down menu for selecting your favourite package
- ♾️ automatic program updates for new releases
- 🚩 international support for all countries
- 💻 custom PowerShell code with custom editor
- 📲 keep your old EuroScope settings after update

## How do I use it?
First you have to download the .exe-File from the releases tab. After that just run the file, change the settings as you need them and browse through the regions and packages. When you've found your package, just select it and click **Update AIRAC**.
Wait one moment and you're ready to go! 🥳

## Can you see my credentials?
No, absolutely not. That's the reason why I've published the code on GitHub. This program only needs your internet connection for the Autoupdater and AIRAC downloader. Of course you're free to compile it yourself! If you have any question regarding any topic feel free to contact me here: **Saugstauber#2252**

## Oh wait, there's something wrong with it!
Issues and bugs can happen. Please report them in the [**Issues**](https://github.com/saugstauberr/ToolScope-for-EuroScope/issues) tab. Thank you very much! 😊
